# ruvds_vps (Resource)

VPS resource for managing virtual servers

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ruvds_vps" "my_vps" {
  datacenter_id   = 1
  tariff_id       = 14
  payment_period  = 2
  os_id           = 255
  cpu             = 1
  ram             = 1.0
  drive           = 20
  drive_tariff_id = 1
  ip              = 1
}

output "my_vps_output" {
  value = resource.ruvds_vps.my_vps
}

# Creates a new virtual server with the specified hardcoded parameters (mandatory).
# These parameters can also be replaced with variables or data sources as needed.
